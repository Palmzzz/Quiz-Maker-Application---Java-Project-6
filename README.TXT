My sixth project was to create a Quiz Maker/Manager application 

This project allowed me to develop my own specification analysis skills, as well as making informed design choices. 

My end product was an application called ‘QuizWizard’ that allows academic staff to create and manage exam papers with multiple-choice questions. 


My Quiz can contain an arbitrary number of questions, and can be added, replaced or removed at any time. 

A question has a set number of answers, labelled with, for example, (a), (b) etc. The manager inputting question specifies the number of answers when creating a question. 

Each quiz contains a reference to the module it will assess, for example, “DC100: Foundations of Software Engineering” 

Each QuizWizrd is compiled specifically for a purchaser/user, and every quiz is associated with the application contains an owner, where the owner is the name of the purchaser of this QuizWizard and can’t be changed when the Quiz is running. 

The owner is internal information and does not get printed with the quiz contents, however, it is possible to retrieve the owner associated with the quiz, before starting to use the system to create the quiz.
